# Ocean Coral Theme
This is a custom VSCode theme inspired by coral reefs and the ocean. While this is meant for my own personal use, you can use it too!

# Want any changes?
If you want to change some colors, feel free to fork / clone this repository and change the colors for yourself! Make sure you change some important attributes in the **package.json** file as this theme is on the marketplace.

Or alternatively, you can make a pull request and leave a comment!

## What to change in the package.json if you decide to change some stuff
- "publisher": Replace this field with your VSCode Marketplace account name
- "repository": Replace this url with your own repository

**Thank you for using my theme!**
